        I have created a social media hashtag{" "}
        <NewTabAnchor href="https://x.com/search?q=%23RamusRange">
          #RamusRange

        <br />
        Players from VRChat have shared pictures and videos taken within the
        experience using this hashtag.
      </p>

      <p>
        A lot of these posts are players sharing their high scores on the
        different challenges.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to pictures of high scores, there are a lot of short films
        and videos filmed within the experience.
